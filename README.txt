Logistic Regression applyed concepts in Python

    Logistic regression is a statistical and machine learning technique used for binary classification problems, 
    The output of logistic regression is a number between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as the probability of the input being classified as a '1', 'true', or 'positive' in the binary classification problem. 
    To convert its output into a probability, logistic regression uses a logistic function, the sigmoid function. 
    The sigmoid function can take any input value and transform it into an output value between 0 and 1.

Supervised ML & Sentiment Analysis
    In supervised machine learning, the algorithm learns from labeled data. 
    When you train a supervised machine learning model, 
    you're providing it with pairs of inputs and their desired outputs, which are also known as the labels. 
    The goal of the model is to learn a function that maps inputs to outputs. 
    After training, the model should be able to take a new, unseen input and predict the corresponding output.

Preprocessing:  
    * Stemming: This is the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their root or stem formâ€”base or root form. 
    For instance, the stem of the words "jumps", "jumped", and "jumping" is "jump".
